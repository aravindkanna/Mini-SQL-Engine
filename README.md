# Mini-SQL-Engine - Engine
A Mini SQL Engine implemented in PYTHON

Type of Queries implemented here:â€‹
kuch bhi
1.   Select all records : Select * from table_name; 

2.   Aggregate functions: Simple aggregate functions on a single column. 
Sum, average, max and min. They will be very trivial given that the data is only numbers: select max(col1) from table1; 

3.   Project Columns(could be any number of columns) from one or more tables : Select col1, col2 from table_name; 

4.   Select/project with distinct from one table : select distinct(col1), distinct(col2) from table_name; 

5.   Select with where from one or more tables: select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where col1 = 10 AND col2 = 20; 
  a.   In the where queries, there would be a maximum of one AND/OR operator with no NOT operators. 

6.   Projection of one or more(including all the columns) from two tables with one join condition :  
  a.   select * from table1, table2 where table1.col1=table2.col2; 
  b.   select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where table1.col1=table2.col2;
